# Agents guidelines

When working on this project, please follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and quality across all contributions.

## Where to start

Begin by reviewing the `README.md` file, 

If present, to understand the project's purpose and setup instructions. Next, familiarize yourself with the `PRD.md` for product requirements and `STEPS.md` for the incremental development plan.

If no `PRD.md` file exists, ask the user for the product requirements document (PRD) content to guide the development plan, or discuss the project goals and features together with them to create one.

If no `STEPS.md` file exists, refer to the template below to create a structured development plan and save it as `STEPS.md` in the project root.

After the initial setup, based on feedback and evolving requirements, you may need to extend or modify the development plan. Refer to the "Iteration Workflows" section below for guidance on managing these changes.

## Core Template

```
Create an incremental development plan for: [README.md project description]

Requirements: [PRD.md content if available]

Generate a plan with:
1. 6-10 logical stages building on each other
2. 2-4 atomic commits per stage
3. Clear checkpoints after each stage
4. Time estimates
5. Iteration workflows for post-launch changes
```

Save the output as `STEPS.md` in the project root.

## Stage Structure

### Standard Progression

```
Stage 1: Proof of Concept - Hardcoded, single feature, validates approach
Stage 2: Dynamic Input - Real data, user choices
Stage 3: Persistence - Save/load state
Stage 4: Alternative Modes - Different paths through the system
Stage 5: Extended Features - Non-core functionality
Stage 6: Refactoring - DRY, modularity (only after features work)
Stage 7: Error Handling - Validation, edge cases
Stage 8: Documentation - README, examples
```

### Stage Template

```markdown
## Stage N: [Goal]
**Goal**: [One sentence describing what this stage achieves]

### Commit 1: [Action]
**What**: [One sentence]
- [Specific change]
- [Specific change]
- [Specific change]

### Commit 2: [Action]
**What**: [One sentence]
- [Specific change]
- [Specific change]

**Checkpoint**: [Demo-able capability]. **Ship it.**
**Time**: [X hours, Y commits]
```

---

## Commit Guidelines

### Rules

- **1-5 files changed**
- **15-60 minutes** to implement
- **One purpose**: add feature OR refactor OR fix (not multiple)
- **Leaves code working** - must be testable after commit

### Format

```bash
type: short description

- What changed
- Why it changed
- How to test it
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `style`

### Examples

**Good commits:**
```
feat: add user authentication
- Create login form component
- Add JWT token validation
- Store user session in localStorage

fix: handle missing email field
- Add validation before submit
- Show error message to user
- Prevent form submission

refactor: extract API client
- Move all fetch calls to api/client.js
- Centralize error handling
- No behavior changes
```

**Bad commits:**
```
update stuff (vague, unclear what changed)
fix everything (too broad, multiple concerns)
WIP authentication (not in working state)
```

---

## Checkpoints

After each stage, define what is demo-able:

**Format:**
```
**Checkpoint**: [Specific user-visible capability]. **Ship it.**
```

**Good checkpoints:**
```
✅ Users can create and view todo items
✅ Data persists between browser sessions
✅ Errors show helpful messages with recovery steps
```

**Bad checkpoints:**
```
❌ API layer is complete (too technical)
❌ Almost done (not concrete)
❌ Architecture is solid (not testable)
```

---

## Time Estimates

### Per Commit Type

- Simple feature: 30-60 min
- API integration: 45-90 min
- Refactoring: 60-120 min
- Documentation: 30-45 min

### Reality Checks

- Stage > 8 hours → split it
- Commit > 2 hours → break it down
- Total > 40 hours → multiple epics needed

---

## Best Practices Section

Every plan should include:

```markdown
## Development Best Practices

### 1. Test After Each Commit
[Specific commands for this project]

### 2. Commit Message Format
[Examples with project context]

### 3. Keep Main Files Simple
[What good structure looks like]

### 4. One Thing Breaks? Stop and Fix
[Debugging approach]

### 5. Don't Add While Refactoring
[Maintain discipline]
```

---

## Red Flags Section

Include 4-6 project-specific warnings:

```markdown
## Red Flags

🚩 **"While I'm here..."** → Save it for later
🚩 **Commit touches 10+ files** → Break it down
🚩 **"Almost done" on day 3 of Stage 1** → Over-engineering
🚩 **No demo after 5 commits** → Increments too small or broken
🚩 **Refactoring in Stage 2** → Too early, features first
🚩 **Skipping tests "temporarily"** → Technical debt starts
```

---

## Iteration Workflows

### Triage Framework

```
Feedback received
├─ Bug?
│  ├─ Critical (breaks core) → HOT FIX (immediate, 1 commit)
│  └─ Non-critical → MINI-PLAN (1-3 commits)
└─ Feature/Enhancement?
   ├─ Small (<1 hour) → Single commit
   ├─ Medium (1-3 hours) → Mini-plan (2-4 commits)
   └─ Large (>3 hours) → Full stage plan
```

### Decision Matrix

| Type | Files | Time | Needs Plan? |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| Typo/docs | 1 | 5 min | ❌ |
| Simple bug | 1-2 | <30 min | ❌ |
| Complex bug | 3+ | >1 hour | ✅ |
| Small enhancement | 1-2 | <1 hour | ⚠️ |
| New feature | 3+ | >2 hours | ✅ |
| Refactoring | 2+ | >1 hour | ✅ |

## Iteration Anti-Patterns

### "Quick Fix" Trap
```
Problem: "Just quickly add..."
Result: No plan, scope creep, breaks things
Solution: Even "quick" changes need a commit plan
```

### "While I'm Here" Syndrome
```
Problem: Fixing bug + refactoring + new feature in one commit
Result: Unreviewable, risky, hard to debug
Solution: Fix bug, ship it, then plan other work separately
```

### "Just Ship It" Approach
```
Problem: Skip tests and planning for "urgent" work
Result: Technical debt, more bugs, slower overall
Solution: Hot fixes only for critical issues, otherwise plan it
```

### "Eternal PR" Problem
```
Problem: 300 files, 47 commits, one massive PR
Result: Unreviewable, blocks progress, usually rejected
Solution: Multiple small PRs following stage boundaries
```

### Commit 1: Add README
**What**: Document the project
- How to use
- Feature list
- Technical details
- Future improvements

**Checkpoint**: Project is documented. **Ship it.**

---

## Development Best Practices

### 1. Test After Each Commit
```bash
# Open index.html in browser
# Test new functionality
# Test existing functionality didn't break
```

### 2. Commit Messages
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add delete button to todo items"
git commit -m "fix: prevent empty todos from being added"
git commit -m "refactor: extract localStorage to storage module"
```

### 3. Keep app.js Organized
By Stage 6, your code should have clear sections:
```javascript
// Data
let todos = [];

// Storage
function saveTodos() { }
function loadTodos() { }

// Rendering
function renderTodos() { }

// Actions
function addTodo() { }
function deleteTodo() { }
function toggleTodo() { }

// Init
init();
```

### 4. One Thing Breaks? Stop and Fix
If adding delete breaks add functionality, stop. Fix the regression before continuing.

### 5. Don't Refactor While Adding Features
Stage 6 is for refactoring only. Don't add new features during cleanup.

---

## Red Flags

🚩 **"Let me also add edit functionality..."** → One feature at a time
🚩 **Commit changes 8 files** → Too big, break it down
🚩 **Still working on Stage 1 after 3 hours** → Overcomplicating
🚩 **Skipped localStorage tests** → Will cause problems later
🚩 **Refactoring in Stage 2** → Too early, wait until Stage 6

---

## Iteration Example: Post-Launch Bug

### Bug Report
"App crashes when localStorage is full"

### Triage
- Type: Bug
- Severity: High (crashes app)
- Complexity: Medium (need quota handling)
- Time: 1.5 hours, 2 commits

### Mini-Plan

#### Bug Fix: Handle localStorage quota exceeded

**Context**: Issue #12 - App crashes when storage full
**Goal**: Graceful degradation when quota exceeded
**Time**: 1.5 hours, 2 commits

**Commit 1: Add quota detection**
```
What: Detect QuotaExceededError
- Wrap saveTodos in try/catch
- Catch QuotaExceededError specifically
- Log error to console
```

**Commit 2: Fallback to memory mode**
```
What: Continue working without persistence
- Set flag when quota exceeded
- Show warning banner to user
- Keep todos in memory only
- Explain how to free space
```

**Checkpoint**:
✅ App doesn't crash when storage full
✅ User sees helpful warning
✅ Can still use app in current session
```
